Main function:
     main_SMC.m - An ad hoc designed SMC algorithm for Bayesian multiple testing.
     
Data files:
    data_simulated.mat - Example data z (test statistics) and X (covariates) 

We have a paper describing the algorithm in details with its application for neural interaction detection 
with real data analysis.
