Main function:
     main_SMC.m - An ad hoc designed SMC algorithm for Bayesian multiple testing.
     
Data files:
    data_simulated.mat - Example data z (test statistics) and X (covariates) 

We have a paper describing the algorithm in details with its application for neural interaction detection 
with real data analysis. If you use the code in your work, please cite our paper as follows
